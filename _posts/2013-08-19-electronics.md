title: Rekindling my Love of Electronics
---

As a kid I was always pulling apart devices and toys to see how the electronics in them worked. I burnt myself many times with the soldering iron. These days with the Arduino and Raspberry Pi it is so easy to get into electronics that I've decided to spend some time again rekindling my interested in this field.

I just got my Arduino microcontroller stater kit.

So far all I have done is verify that it all works by writing a small bit of code that blinks the onboard LED on and off.

Next steps are to work through the projects in that book and then work on a couple of home automation projects I have in mind. My ultimate goal will be to hook it all up to the internet from my home using a Raspberry Pi as the web server to display various stats about the sensors around the house.
